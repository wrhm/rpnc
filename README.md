Reverse Polish Notation Calculator (rpnc)

Uses Python to implement an RPN (postfix) calculator.
Currently allows these operations:
 - Unary - fib
 - Binary - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation; arithmetic and geometric means.
 - Ternary - quad1, quad 2
Also has built-in constants (e, pi, phi). Constants are either exact or decent aymptotic approximations.
