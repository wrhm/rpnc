Reverse Polish Notation Calculator (rpnc)

Uses Python to implement an RPN (postfix) calculator.
Currently allows addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
Also has built-in constants (e, pi, phi) and custom unary operators (fib). Constants are either exact or decent aymptotic approximations.

Still want: ternary quadratic root operator.
